Branching journeys mean users only see the content and questions that are relevant to them.

For example we can check if the user is eligible for the service. If they are not eligible, we can explain why before they waste their time on more questions.

You can use simple links to take users on different branching journeys. Branching based on form fields is a little harder, which is what we'll cover in these guides.

To make branching journeys you will need to know [how to use routes](create-routes).
